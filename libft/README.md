# LIBFT

---
Please not that for now I'm not sure that I have the last subject. So modifications will be made in the future.

This is the folder for the LIBFT project of 42 Lausanne.

In the Makefile you can see the different sources :

- Required for the project
- Bonus functions
- Supplementary functions

The supplementary functions are not required nor are they in the bonus section
but I added them to have a complete lib of what I need.

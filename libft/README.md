# LIBFT

This is the folder for the LIBFT project of 42 Lausanne.

In the Makefile you can see the different sources :

- Required for the project
- Bonus functions
- Supplementary functions

The supplementary functions are not required nor are they in the bonus section
but I added them to have a complete lib of what I need.

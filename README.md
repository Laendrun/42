# 42 Lausanne

This repo will (if I don't forget) save all my projects during the 42 cursus at 42 Lausanne.

<sup>1</sup> I won't be able to correct it since I validated `so_long`, if someone can send me the evaluation question for `FdF` I will check mine against it and determine which mark I would have got.

## Unfinished

For **ft_printf**, I tried to do the bonuses, it didn't work. I mean it works but I didn't do any error handling so when you send it a value that's not correct (i.e. sending a negative value when using **%u**, will have an unpredictable result).
If at some point I have some time to do it, I'll try again, but don't expect that soon, I have enough to do apart from that.

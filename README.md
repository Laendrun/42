> I did this project only because it's interesting to me, I won't be able to correct it since I will validate `pipex`. I heard that
> pipex is very useful for `minishell` so I decided to do it first, and to validate it instead of `minitalk` which is easier as per
> what some people told me. It supports unicode characters and sends a confirmation message to the client after having wrote the
> message on the server side. 

## Unfinished

For **ft_printf**, I tried to do the bonuses, it didn't work. I mean it works but I didn't do any error handling so when you send it a value that's not correct (i.e. sending a negative value when using **%u**, will have an unpredictable result).
If at some point I have some time to do it, I'll try again, but don't expect that soon, I have enough to do apart from that.
